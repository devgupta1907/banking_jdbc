# Bank Management System with Java and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)

I have created this project to learn and practice JDBC. I used JDBC to insert, retrieve, update values in the database. I have used PostgreSQL database for this project.

- Users can create a user account. Whenever a user account is created, a bank account is generated automatically for that user with a unique account number. 
- User's unique contact number is mapped with the accounts table. So users can access their bank accounts with their contact number. They don't have to remember their bank account number for convenience.
- Users can add, withdraw, and transfer funds to other users using their contact number.
