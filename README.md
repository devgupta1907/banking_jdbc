## Bank Management System with Java and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)

This project serves as a comprehensive learning experience, allowing me to delve into the intricacies of Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). By leveraging JDBC, I have implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within a PostgreSQL database, effectively managing bank account data.

In this Banking System, users can create bank accounts, with each account automatically generating a unique identifier. To enhance user experience, the system maps a user's contact number to their account, eliminating the need to memorize account numbers for transactions.

Functionality extends to various financial operations, empowering users to:

- **Deposit funds**: Increase their account balance.
- **Withdraw funds**: Decrement their account balance, adhering to pre-defined withdrawal limits.
- **Transfer funds**: Seamlessly transfer funds to other user accounts linked to registered contact numbers.
- **Access transaction history**: Gain a comprehensive overview of their financial activity through detailed transaction statements.
  
This project demonstrates a solid foundation in JDBC and database management, offering a robust and user-centric banking application prototype.
